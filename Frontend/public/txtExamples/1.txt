In Vue 3, the `defineProps` macro is a feature introduced with the Composition API to define component props in a more streamlined way, especially when using `<script setup>`. The line `defineProps({ content: String });` is using this macro to declare that the component expects to receive a prop named `content` of type `String`.

Here's a breakdown of its function:

- `defineProps`: This is a compiler macro provided by Vue for use within the `<script setup>` context. Its purpose is to define the props that your component will accept.

- `{ content: String }`: This object is the definition of the expected props. It declares a prop named `content` and specifies that its expected data type is `String`.

In a typical Vue component, you would define props using the `props` option in the options API, like this:

```javascript
export default {
  props: {
    content: {
      type: String
    }
  }
}
```



Using `<script setup>` and `defineProps`, it becomes more concise:

```vue
<script setup>
const props = defineProps({
  content: String
});
</script>
```

However, you don't actually need to assign `defineProps` to a variable unless you intend to use it within the `<script setup>`. If you simply want to declare props without further manipulation, you can use it as a standalone statement:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorldApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string name = "Oak";
            Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");
        }
    }
}
```

However, you don't actually need to assign `defineProps` to a variable unless you intend to use it within the `<script setup>`. If you simply want to declare props without further manipulation, you can use it as a standalone statement:

---

```typescript 
<script setup>
defineProps({
  content: String
});
</script>
```

This approach seamlessly integrates with TypeScript, provides better type inference, and aligns with the ergonomic improvements aimed with `<script setup>`.


It will render well but without Vue-specific highlights (e.g. for `<template>`, `ref`, etc.).

### ✅ 3. **Other Option: Use `prismjs` for better SFC support**

If Vue highlighting is essential, consider using [`prismjs`](https://prismjs.com/), which has better community-maintained SFC support, or libraries like:

- [`shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) (used by VitePress, super accurate)
- [`vue-highlight.js`](https://github.com/metachris/vue-highlightjs) (Vue plugin for highlight.js)

### Summary

| Option             | Vue SFC Support | Performance | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| Manually register `vue` | ✅ Good         | ✅ Fast       | Works with Highlight.js core |
| Use `html` block    | ⚠️ Basic        | ✅ Fast       | Not Vue-aware |
| Use `prismjs`       | ✅ Great        | ⚠️ Larger     | More detailed, heavier |
| Use `shiki`         | ✅ Excellent    | ⚠️ Heavier    | VS Code-level accuracy |
